# NN-framework-python
Here is my pseudo-framework that helps build deep neural networks. 
When implementing the architecture, the author was inspired by pytorch.

Framework implements:
- Layers
    - Linear
    - Sorfmax
    - Dropout
    - Batchnorm
    - Relu & LReLU
    - Sigmoid
- Losses
    - MSE
    - Binary CrossEntropy
- Optimizers
    - SGD
    - Adam
    - RMSprop

Thanks for your attantion!
